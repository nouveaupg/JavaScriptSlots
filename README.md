# Slot Machine

This is a JavaScript program I wrote really quickly 5 years ago for a 42 inch touch screen kiosk. 
Which was powered by a MacMini running this in Chrome. What I really liked about this project is that it uses
SVG graphics extensively so it is usable/testable on either a laptop or huge screen at Oracle World.

For all the JavaScript haters, I will have to say, this still works after 5 years. Whereas an iOS app from five 
years ago probably has all sorts of deprecated things.

The backend is intended to post data to https://www.cloudcms.com/, or what it was at that time... I would probably 
do something simpler with MySQL/Python/Flask if I were the one making that decision. Actually at the time we were looking
into PHP but now definitely Python/Flask.

Line for line this is my most successful program and a good example of sales tactical engineering. Don't think there are 
much more than 1000 lines of JavaScript, and this was incredibly popular, drawing a massive line. Even though there is not 
much Computer Science involved, something about slot machines attracts people. Good way to collect e-mail addresses. Not 
sure how useful they turned out to be but they could be good leads...
